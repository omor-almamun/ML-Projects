# GP Optimization

This project involves airfoil optimization using Gaussian Processes (GPs).

## Objective

The objective is to find the optimal thickness and camber that minimizes the lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) using Gaussian Processes.

## Files

- `gp_airfoil_optimization.py`: Main script for GP-based optimization.
- `GP Homework!.py`: Alternative script for the optimization process.
- `temp.zip`: Contains additional resources or data files needed for the optimization process.
  - `data/`: Directory containing datasets used for training and validation.
  - `config/`: Directory containing configuration files for the optimization process.
  - `scripts/`: Directory containing additional scripts used in the project.

## Instructions

1. **Extract temp.zip**:
   - Extract the contents of `temp.zip` into the `GP-Optimization` directory. Ensure the `data`, `config`, and `scripts` directories are correctly placed.

2. **Run the Scripts**:
   - Run the `gp_airfoil_optimization.py` script for the GP-based approach.
   - Alternatively, you can use the `GP Homework!.py` script for another variation of the optimization process.

3. **Dependencies**:
   - Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can use `pip` to install any missing dependencies.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
